## Timeline Setup (Crucial)

<Warning>
  **Timeline Rules:**
  - **Audio Tracks:** You must have the **exact same number of audio tracks as speakers**. (e.g., 2 Speakers = 2 Audio Tracks). Deviating from this will cause bugs.
  - **Sync:** Ensure all audio and video tracks are synchronized before starting.
</Warning>
